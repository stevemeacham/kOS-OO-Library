## Install
Copy the `oolib` folder with contents into your KSP installation's `Ships/Script` folder.  If it already exists, replace it.  Carefully.

The files in the `boot` folder may be copied to your existing `boot` folder.  Their names, especially `boot.ks` might conflict with existing boot scripts.  In that case, resolve the naming conflict by changing the filename(s) to be unique.
