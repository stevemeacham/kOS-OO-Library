# The kOS OO Library
This unique kOS library supports class and prototype based object oriented programming and namespaces.  It also uses NO GLOBALS and enables any kOS program or library to do the same, large or small, no matter how complex.
## Requirements and Dependencies
* [Kerbal Space Program (KSP)](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)
* [kOS: Kerbal Operating System (kOS)](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/)
## Technologies
* [KerboScript v1.2.1.0](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/language.html)
## Support
This library is for programmers, so a certain level of technical acumen and initiative is assumed.  Here is the support process:
1. RTFM and do things the way it shows before trying to improve upon it.  If that didn't help...
2. Read the library and example usage code.  If that didn't help...
3. Look for answers in the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/stevemeacham/kOS-OO-Library/issues).
4. Ask for answers in the Github Issue Tracker.

If it was unclear to you, it will be unclear to others.  Become a contributor, pay it forward, and keep it from happening again.
